This directory is for creating a stand-alone BE app that doesn't integrate Angular.

This *copies* the .js that are needed.

Do NOT edit the source files (ie .js files) in this folder or subfolders.

.gitignore ignores .js files so they are not archived in git!

commands

npm install
npm run build
npm run start

to remove all output files generated by "npm run build"
npm run clean
